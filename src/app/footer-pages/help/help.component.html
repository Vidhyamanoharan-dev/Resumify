  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>

  <h3>1. How do I upload my resume?</h3>
  <p>
    To upload your resume, you need to be signed in to your account. Once logged in, click the <strong>“Upload Resume”</strong> button in the navigation bar. You can then select your PDF resume, and it will be parsed automatically.
  </p>

  <h3>2. What happens after I upload my resume?</h3>
  <p>
    Our system will extract key information such as your name, contact details, education, skills, and work experience. This information will be displayed in a clean, structured format for your review.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Do I need an account to use the resume upload feature?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes, only registered and logged-in users can upload resumes and access parsed resume data. This ensures your data is private and securely stored.
  </p>

  <h3>4. Can I edit or delete my uploaded resume details?</h3>
  <p>
    Currently, manual editing is not supported. However, you can delete your uploaded resume and upload a new version if needed. This feature is available in your <strong>Dashboard</strong> after logging in.
  </p>

  <h3>5. What file formats are supported for upload?</h3>
  <p>
    We currently support only <strong>PDF (.pdf)</strong> files for resume parsing. Make sure your resume is saved in a supported format before uploading.
  </p>

  <h3>6. Why can’t I log in to my account?</h3>
  <p>
    Double-check your email and password. If you’ve forgotten your password, click the <strong>“Forgot Password?”</strong> link on the login page to reset it. If you're new, make sure you've registered and activated your account through the confirmation email.
  </p>

  <h3>7. Does this platform help me build or check my resume?</h3>
  <p>
    No. This platform is focused on <strong>uploading</strong> and <strong>parsing</strong> resumes only. We do not currently offer resume creation or ATS scoring features.
  </p>

  <h3>8. Is my resume data safe?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes. Your uploaded resumes and parsed information are only visible to you after logging in. We follow standard data protection practices to keep your information secure.
